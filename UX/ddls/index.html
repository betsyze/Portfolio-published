                        <p class="copy">Discover’s design system needed a refresh. Although the system was cohesive in
                            its reflection of the Discover brand identity, there was room for improvement in
                            documentation detail. Digital accessibility could also be improved for the benefit of this
                            banking apps diverse users. FCB’s Digital Products team was brought on to develop a design
                            system that could modernize Discover’s app and website: and the results were Radiant
                            (...sorry).

                        </p>
                        <p class="copy">My first role on the Radiant taskforce was researching <b>accessibility</b>:
                            once a component’s fundamentals
                            passed through the initial client approval check, I created through WCAG-informed guidance
                            for content authors and developers. Later on, I started leading research for new UI
                            components,
                            orienting UI designers to each component’s guidelines and standards.</p>

                        <p class="copy">Radiant is a multi-platform design system, with libraries accounting for iOS and
                            Android. Browser support is described in the documentation for each component and pattern
                            when divergent from app experiences.</p>
                        <p class="copy">There are three primary design system libraries: components (split into iOS and
                            Android), UI foundations, and utilities.</p>

                        <p class="copy">UI foundations are the building blocks of the design system. They include color
                            palettes, typography, spacing, and other foundational elements that define the visual
                            language of the system.
                            During my time on the team, we began integrating design tokens into our workflow.
                            Two tiers of tokens store primitive values, and then add specificity of usage.
                            Design tokens are synced with Figma as variables and connected to color, typography, and
                            effects styles.

                        <p class="copy">We took great pride in accounting for accessibility in our design system. This
                            included ensuring that all color contrasts met WCAG standards, and that all UI components
                            were fully accessible to users with disabilities.</p>

                        <p class="copy">Beyond visual design, we were tasked with researching and designing over ##
                            design system components. To keep track, we started work in a research file, where we used
                            templated
                            research documentation to maintain consistency and clarity across all component research
                            efforts. Every stage of Radiant Design was considered. We wanted a highly organized
                            workflow to account for the complexity of the project.</p>
                        <p class="copy">Our process docs were key: everything was documented and shared across teams.
                            This ensured no information was lost and new team members wouldn't be left behind.</p>

                        <p class="copy">Once all our ducks were in a row, we conducted extensive research on existing UI
                            components from the existing
                            design system to ensure that our new and improved 2.0 design system was both functional and
                            user-friendly.
                            This involved analyzing user behavior, identifying common patterns, and documenting best
                            practices for component usage.</p>

                            <p class="copy">During my time on the Radiant team, he new design system was launched for
                                the app landing page, AC (Account Center) Home. However, the Discover app (and Radiant
                                with it) has been sunset, due to Discover's acquisition by Capital One.</p>
                            <p class="subhead">Our wins:</p>
                            <p class="copy">• The new design system was well-received by the client and users, with
                                positive feedback on the improved accessibility and usability of the components.</p>
                            <p class="copy">• <b>Internal efficiency:</b> We massively scaled up our internal
                                efficiency. Our rigorous, thorough
                                process could now be extended to all our future work.</p>
                            <p class="copy">• <b>Accessibility:</b> The Discover app was made more accessible for users
                                dependent on technology like screenreaders and keyboard navigators. I'm proud to have
                                made accessing financial information easier and more equitable for all users.</p>

                        <p class="copy">• The importance of documentation: Thorough documentation was key to our
                            success. It ensured that everyone on the team was on the same page and that no information
                            was lost during the design process. This level of thorough attention to detail was a
                            worthwhile challenge during my earliest days on the team.</p>
                        <p class="copy">• The value of research: Our extensive research on existing UI components was
                            crucial in ensuring that our new design system was both functional and user-friendly. My
                            working knowledge of building with both Figma and code increased rapidly, inspiring me to
                            start building my own systems. (see: this website!)</p>
                        <p class="copy">• The impact of accessibility: Designing with accessibility in mind gives my UX
                            work a broader reach and a more distinct sense of purpose. I now have a the WCAG principles
                            deeply integrated into my process and work ethic: I'm proud that equity and access is at the
                            heart of everything I do.</p>
